Monte Carlo simulations allow researchers to learn about the finite sample properties of the estimators.
%Small sample properties provide insights for the applied researcher. 
This section contains the simulations. All simulations are based on R = 1000 replications. When we evaluate the coverage of confidence intervals, the nominal level is always 95 percent. Number of observations are N= 50, 100, 1000 and the time periods are T=5,10,20.
