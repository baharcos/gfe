\subsection{Setup}\label{section:DGP}
The data generating process (DGP) is same across all simulations although the fitted model changes.
The dependent variable is generated as follows:
\begin{align}
 y_{it} = x_{it}'\theta^0 + \alpha_{g_i^0t}^0 + \upsilon_{it}, \hspace{0.3cm} i=1,...,N,  \hspace{0.2cm} t=1,...,T, \hspace{0.2cm} g=1,2=G^0.
\end{align}
The error terms are i.i.d. standard normal: $\upsilon_{it} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$

The regressors are generated as follows:
%Covariate $X_1$ is linearly correlated with grouped fixed-effects:
\begin{align}
x_{i(g)t1} = 0.2 alpha_{gt} + u_{it},
\end{align}
%while covariate $X_2$ is non-linearly  correlated:
\begin{align}
    x_{i(g)t2} = 0.05alpha_{gt}^3 + u_{it},
\end{align}
where $u_{it}  \sim Unif(-3,3)$.

The parameters are defines as:
\begin{align}
    \theta^0 = \left[\begin{array}{c}
         0.1 \\
         0.5
    \end{array}\right]
\end{align}
\begin{align}
     \alpha_1^0 = e^{\frac{t}{20}}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    \alpha_2^0 = -\dfrac{t}{5}
\end{align}
The population is equally divided into two groups.

%Furthermore, we restrict our attention to a static panel where all the regressors in the model have the same time subscript.
