Suppose $\{X_1, \dots, X_n\}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. $\mathbb{R}^k$ valued random variables  i.e. a random sample from a distribution.
Let $\Bar{X}_n$ denote the sample mean $\dfrac{1}{N}\sumi X_i$ and $\EX(X_n)$ exists then $\Bar{X}_n \overset{p}{\to} \EX(X_n)$. 

In the case where $X_i$ and $X_j$ for $i \neq j$ is not independent
but uncorrelated random variables, we would additionally need to assume existence of the variance to get this result.


\subsection{Central Limit Theorem}

Suppose $\{X_1, \dots, X_n\}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. $\mathbb{R}^k$ valued random variables and suppose $\EX(X_n) = \mu$ and $Cov(X_n)= \Sigma$ exists, then $\sqrt{n}(\Bar{X}_n - \mu) \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$.

\subsection{Continuous Mapping Theorem}

Suppose $\{X_1, \dots, X_n\}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. $\mathbb{R}^k$ valued random variables and g: $\mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ is a continuous function:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $X_n \overset{p}{\to} X$ then  $g(X_n) \overset{p}{\to} g(X)$.
    \item If $X_n \overset{d}{\to} X$ then  $g(X_n) \overset{d}{\to} g(X)$.
\end{itemize}
